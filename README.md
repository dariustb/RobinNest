## Status
Project is: *not finished*. The graphs aren't are using template information and aren't accurate to any stock. There are some features I still want to add. I will update the status as I get closer to finishing the work.

## Inspiration
This project was challenged to me by a peer I worked on a separate project with in college. We're racing to finish the project and loser buys the winner a penny stock.
